#1) fund show_view any? returns true to an array with nothing in it
#2) fund show_view error_messages are not showing up
#3) month form_for limit date to only the current dates
#4) When creating the restrictions on types of users, make a list of them - both for the controllers and resources

#10) fix the logic for months and creating new funds
#11) make the number_fields maintain a % symbol while typing 
#12) get rid of month_index view
#13) make a different css tag for centering.  change from fieldset 
#14) ORDER the models by specific FIELDS
#15) make all names case insensitive in the models  
#16) make users only able to belong to 1 fund (make unique by email address)
#17) in the submenu, the link_to Current_Month does not de-link when logging in because it is calling root, not current_month.  make the current_month link de-link when logging in and being directed to root.
